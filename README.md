# Homely - ASP.NET Core 'Hosting' core application-library.
This application-library contains an opinioned `program.cs` class which is to reduce the ceremony for creating ASP.NET Core "Web Hosting" applications. 

Basically, we (at Homely) use the same `program.cs` code for litterally all of our microservices. So instead of just copying/pasting this code or having [this same code in our Template](https://github.com/Homely/Homely.AspNetCore.WebApi.Template), we've provided this code as a NuGet package so it's easy to update all-or-any microservice if we decide to change something (e.g. we decide to change to a different logging framework).

NOTE: This is a `netcoreapp` application and not a `netstandard` library. So it can only be referenced in another `netcoreapp` .NET Core Application.

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/m97lxr4ytwvmhfqj/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Homely/homely-aspnetcore-hosting-coreapp/branch/master)

## Why use this? What's wrong with the default standard program.cs?

We're just _extending_ the default `program.cs` content that comes out of the box by:

- Wrapping the default code inside `Serilog` error handling. So if _any_ error occurs at any stage of the program (most importantly, at the EARLY starting/initialization stages, `Serilog` will nicely handle this.
- Logging some important*** information about the web api: assembly date, version and when this program first started.

That's it :) 

Reducing boilerplate code.

*** We (at Homely) thinks this is importnat!

## How to use this library
1. install-package Homely.AspNetCore.Hosting.CoreApp.Program.Main into your ASP.NET Core application.
2. Reference the `Main<T>` method. You can optionally provide some customization ... if you feel like it.

## Simple quickstart

```
public static Task Main(string[] args)
{
    return Homely.AspNetCore.Hosting.CoreApp.Main<Startup>(args);
}
```

NOTE: the `Startup` class should be _your_ `Startup.cs` class.

## More customized startup

```
public static Task Main(string[] args)
{
    var options = new MainOptions
    {
        CommandLineArguments = args,
        FirstLoggingInformationMessage = "~~ Accounts Web Api ~~",
        LogAssemblyInformation = true,
        LastLoggingInformationMessage = "-- Accounts Web Api has ended/terminated --",
        EnvironmentVariableKey = "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT"
    };

    return Homely.AspNetCore.Hosting.CoreApp.Main<Startup>(options);
}
```
